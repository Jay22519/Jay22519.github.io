### Weekly Update  

#### Update for Week [15<sup>th</sup> Feb - 21<sup>th</sup> Feb]
Algorithms and Model to use for Language Processing has been added . Link is <a href = 'https://jay22519.github.io/Language_processing/'>Language Processing Module</a> <br>
OCR and Autocorrect module used for Image processing has been added. Link is <a href = 'https://jay22519.github.io/Image_processing/'>Image Processing Module</a> 


## Problem Statement 
Creating an automatic answer checker web application for students and teachers, for grading of the answers submitted by students against an ideal solution uploaded by the teacher. 

### Rough outline  
- Students upload their hand-written answer sheets which will be converted to text.
- The solution provided by the students will be automatically marked against the ideal/correct answer given by the evaluator/professor, using AI to check similarity of the two answers 
- After evaluation the evaluator/professor can verify the marks and can also overwrite the marks awarded by the system.  
  
### Tech Stack  
1. Web application will be deployed using Django  
2. Image and Language processing will be done using Python Deep Learning APIs  
3. Database to use - [to be decided]  
4. Frontend application and designing - [to be decided]
