## Problem Statement 

Creating a web application for automatic answer checking 

### Rough outline 

Students can upload their hand written answer sheets which will be converted to text and will be automatically marked against the ideal/correct answer given by the evaluator/professor. After evaluation the evaluator/professor can verify the marks and can also overwrite the awarded marks  


### Tech Stack 
1) Web application will be deployed using Django 
2) Image and Language processing will be done using Python DL APIs
3) Database to use -> {To be decided}
4) Fronted application and designing -> {To be decided}

Further things to be added ..................
