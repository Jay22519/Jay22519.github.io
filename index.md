-  Admin or professor will upload all the answer sheets of students at once and will also provide the ideal answer against which students answer will be graded  
-  Then the system using OCR technique will convert the image into text 
-  Language processing module will then check the similarity between student's answer and ideal answer submitted and accordinly allocate the marks to student
